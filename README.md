# MoSIG Computer Graphics 2 - Lab Work

This is my implementation for the MoSIG Computer Graphics 2 Rendering Lab Work. So far, it contains a Blinn-Phong Shading and a Cook-Torrance Specular model implementations.

## Execution note

This project is embedded in a QT5 application, so a QT5 developpment environment is required to run the program.
Since this implementation is a little restrictive and tedious, I am currently working on moving the host application code to a Godot project instead.
